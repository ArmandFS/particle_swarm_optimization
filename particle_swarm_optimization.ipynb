    "\n",
    "PSO has been used in various applications, including optimization problems, machine learning, and engineering design. It is particularly effective for problems where the search space is large and complex. For example, PSO has been used to optimize the parameters of texture descriptors in image processing, and to select the most discriminative features for cell classicification."
